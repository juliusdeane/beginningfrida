To compile simple0 executable, just issue:

`gcc -o simple0 simple0.c`

Then just execute it with ./simple0.

You may use Makefile through "make". For example, you can build both binaries (simple0 and simple0_static) with:

`make`

Or select the binary you want to create:

`make simple0`

`make simple0_static`
